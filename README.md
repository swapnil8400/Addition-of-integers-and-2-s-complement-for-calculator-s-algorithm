# Addition-of-integers-and-converting-them-into-2-s-complement-for-calculator-s-algorithm

->The code will be performing addition of signed decimal numbers (integer numbers) in decimal arithmetic and in two's complement representation arithmetic and compare the results

->The aim is to read two integer numbers, compute the two's complement representation of each of the integers, perform the addition of the integers in two's complement.

->Then converting the two's complement result to a decimal and finally compare the result with the result of the addition of the two integers in decimal.
